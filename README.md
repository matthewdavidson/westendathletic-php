### Notes

1. I am still undecided as of how to specify a certain team as the home team.
	 I could add a column to the teams table to indicate whether a team is the 
	 home team or not. But this would result in a lot of unecessary validation 
	 to make sure there was only one home team not to mention bad erm design.
	 I am going to look into setting the home team in a configuration file. This
	 home team can be loaded into the db as seed data. I can then extend the Team
	 model with a helper method such as .home_team? to determine home team logic.
2. The user management is a little off just now. I suppose I can implement two types of
	 admin user, one as the super admin and one that has access to everything apart 
	 from user management. Currently each user has CRUD access to all users. 
3. I realise there is a distinct lack of tests surrounding the current functionality.
	 Keeping in mind [a certain blogpost](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3159-testing-like-the-tsa)
	 I do intend to add some tests around the user admin login and keep on top of
	 things when I encounter some more complicated functionality.
